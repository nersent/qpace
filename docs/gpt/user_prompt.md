Translate PineScript code below into Rust using Pace library.

Important Rules:

1. You must call `next` on all `Incremental` on every tick
2. You are not allowed to call `next` on the same `Incremental` instance more than once per tick
3. Do not assume the existence of any PineScript method or property in Pace, unless it's already documented.
4. If any PineScript method or property is not explictly documented in Pace, you must ask the user to proceed further, before writing rust code.
