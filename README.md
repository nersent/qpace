**qPACE**: The Technical Analysis framework written in Rust, designed to be extremely fast.

Fast, zero runtime cost and memory-safe, but with very high learning curve.

The core feature of Pace is incremental architecture, which allows O(1) constant-time updates of indicators, making it ideal for time-sensitive low-frequency live trading.

> Note: This library is in an early development stage. Expect breaking changes.
