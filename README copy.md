**qPACE**: Technical analysis library written in Rust, designed to be compatible with PineScript.

Fast, zero runtime cost and memory-safe, but with very high learning curve.

The core feature of Pace is incremental architecture, which allows O(1) constant-time updates of indicators, making it ideal for time-sensitive low-frequency live trading.

> Note: This library is in an early development stage. Expect breaking changes.

## PineScript

All Pace components and indicators have been tested against PineScript, ensuring the same results and easy migration.

See [migration from PineScript](/docs/pinescript_migration.md)

## Features

- Results of TA functions same as in PineScript

- Strategy metrics from TradingView

You can use already configured [boilerplate project](https://github.com/nersent/pace-starter) with an example indicator and strategy.

## Examples

See already implemented indicators and strategies [here](pace/src/content).

## Installation

```bash
cargo add nersent_pace
cargo add polars
```

## Motivation

1. State-of-the art

   One of the SOTA technical analysis libraries is the industry golden standard [talib](https://ta-lib.org/), which is written in C and is tailored towards vector calculations. The problem with talib is that it's old (started in 1999) and unmaintained. Adding new features without sacrificing the performance is a great challenge and requires C expertise.

2. PineScript

   No TA lib tries to be compatible with PineScript, which is the most popular way of creating trading strategies. This is crucial as the majority of trading strategies are written in PineScript. Users are limited by TradingView capabilities as there is no way to efficiently optimize strategy parameters.

3. Architecture

   There are different ways of calculating technical analysis indicators such as:

   a. Plain loop

   For each indicator, a loop is performed over the entire dataset. This is the most straightforward way of calculating indicators. It is easy to implement, but it is very slow and memory inefficient.

   b. Vectorization

   For each indicator, a loop is performed over the entire dataset, but the loop is vectorized, meaning CPU instructions are executed in parallel, leading to a significant performance boost. talib is an example of this approach. Vectorization is the best for batch processing, but it is hard to implement and maintain, as any new feature requires to be vectorized as well, which is not always possible. Also, if you want to compute multiple indicators, you have to perform multiple loops.

   c. GPU

   Similar to vectorization, but the calculations are performed on GPU, which is even faster than CPU. It is even harder to implement and maintain than vectorization. Keeping in mind, that there are tools and libraries that don't require you to write custom GPU kernels such as cupy/PyTorch, GPU TA still comes with it's own set of problems. It requires you to have GPU supporting software like CUDA and VRAM large enough. Also copying data from CPU to GPU and back is a performance bottleneck, which may be problematic sometimes.

   d. Incremental

   There is only one main loop, which iterates over the entire dataset. For every loop tick, each indicator is updated in constant O(1) time. This is the best approach if you care about computation delay, as it is fast and memory efficient. In the most cases, it's the easiest way to implement new features. Also, PineScript is incremental by design, so it's easy to port PineScript code to similar architecture.

   Incremental architecture, has it's drawback - it is slower than vectorization, but not that much. For **1M** bars and `SMA(14)` the difference between Pace and talib is **2ms**.

## Benchmarks

We performed multiple benchmarks for popular indicators across different technical analysis libraries:

- [TA-Lib](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python)
- [Pandas TA](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta)
- [TALIpp](https://github.com/nardew/talipp)
- [FinTA](https://github.com/peerchemist/finta)
- [spectre](https://github.com/Heerozh/spectre)
- [TA](https://github.com/bukosabino/ta)
- <https://tulipindicators.org/>
- <https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/>

### Details

- AMD Ryzen 5 3600
- 16GB RAM
- RTX 2060 Super 8GB VRAM
- Windows 11
- Rustc 1.67.0
- Python 3.9
- Pace benchmark uses [mimalloc allocator](https://github.com/purpleprotocol/mimalloc_rust) and has been compiled with [cargo pgo](https://github.com/Kobzol/cargo-pgo)

### Interpretation

- talib is the fastest library across all benchmarks, thanks to vectorization
- Pace is the second fastest library, despite not being designed towards vector calculations
- On smaller datasets, the gap between talib and Pace is not significant
- Pandas and Numpy have both their own runtime overhead
- It's not worth to do technical analysis on GPU for smaller datasets
